## Features

After executing the goal during (e.g. during the `package` phase as shown in the example above) the macOS application bundle will be located in the `PROJECT_NAME.app` directory inside the `target` directory, where `PROJECT_NAME` equals the bundle name entered within the `CFBundleName` setting inside the `plist` configuration, or the name of the Maven project (`${project.name}`) if the value is not present inside the `plist` configuration.

The plugin will detect whether the project is a Java module by checking if the `plist` property `JVMMainModuleName` is present. If that's the case the launcher will use the *modulepath*. Otherwise the regular *classpath* will be used.

## Configuration

### Property list Configuration

The values within the `plist` element are directly transferred to the `Info.plist` file within the application bundle. To keep the usage within the code consistent they use the same keys within the `pom.xml` configuration as they do within the `Info.plist`.

The following values can be configured:

| Key | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `CFBundleIconFile` | File | No | | The `icns` file that should be used as main icon for the application. The location must be entered relatively to the root of the project in which the plugin is used. |
| `CFBundleIdentifier` | String | No | `${groupId}.${artifactId}` | The macOS identifier of your application bundle. |
| `CFBundleDisplayName` | String | No | `${project.name}` | The published name of your application. |
| `CFBundleName` | String | No | `${project.name}` | The internal name of your application. |
| `CFBundleShortVersionString` | String | No | `${version}` | The version of your application. |
| `CFBundleExecutable` | String | No | `JavaLauncher` | The name of the executable within the application bundle. No regular user will ever see this but you may want to change it for debugging purposes when analyzing your application. |
| `CFBundleDevelopmentRegion` | String | No | `English` | The default language and region for the bundle, as a [language ID](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LanguageandLocaleIDs/LanguageandLocaleIDs.html). |
| `CFBundleURLTypes` | Array of Strings | No | | A list of URL schemes (`http`, `ftp`, etc.) supported by the app. |
| `CFBundlePackageType` | String | No | `APPL` | This key consists of a four-letter code for the bundle type. For apps, the code is APPL, for frameworks, it's FMWK, and for bundles, it's BNDL. [Details](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundlepackagetype) |
| `JVMMainClassName` | String | Yes (if the application is a classic classpath based application) | | The main class whose `main` method should be invoked when starting your application. |
| `JVMMainModuleName` | String | Yes (if the application is a module based application) | | The main module that should be invoked when starting your application. |
| `JVMVersion` | String | No | | The Java version your application needs to work. Can either be an explicit version String like `11.0.1`, a major version like `11` (signalizing that *any* Java 11 runtime is sufficient) or a value like `11+` (signalizing that *any* Java 11 *or higher* runtime is sufficient). |
| `JVMOptions` | Array of Strings | No | | Additional parameters (`-D` parameters) to be passed to the runtime. |
| `JVMArguments` | Array of Strings | No | | Additional arguments to be passed to the runtime. |
| `JVMRuntimePath` | String | No | | The exact location of the JVM. |
| `JVMLogLevel` | String | No | `INFO` | The amount of details the launcher will print to the console if called directly from the command line. Possible values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`. |
| `NSHighResolutionCapable` | Boolean | No | `true` | Declares if the application supports rendering in HiDPI (Retina). [Details](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nshighresolutioncapable) |
| `LSUIElement` | Boolean | No | | Declares if the app is an agent app that runs in the background and doesn't appear in the Dock. [Details](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsuielement) |
| `NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching` | Boolean | No | `true` | Declares whether an OpenGL app may utilize the integrated GPU. [Details](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nssupportsautomaticgraphicsswitching) |
| `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` | String | No | | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the device’s microphone. [Details](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsmicrophoneusagedescription) |
| `NSCameraUsageDescription` | String | No | | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the device’s camera. [Details](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription) |
### DMG configuration

The following other properties can be added to the `dmg` element configuring the generation of the DMG file at the end of the build:

| Key | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `generate` | Boolean | No | `false` | Whether or not to create a `DMG` archive. |
| `additionalResources` | List<Fileset> | No | | Additional files to be copied into the archive. |
| `createApplicationsSymlink` | Boolean | No | `true` | Whether or not to include a link to the Applications folder inside the archive. |
| `useGenIsoImage` | Boolean | No | `false` | Whether or not to use `genisoimage` to create the archive. Default is `hdiutil`. |
| `autoFallback` | Boolean | No | `false` | If `true`, try the other archive generation method when the first one fails. (e.g. run `hdiutil` when `genisoimage` fails and vice-versa) |
| `appendVersion` | Boolean | No | `true` | If `true`, append the version to the `.dmg` name
| `dmgFileName` | String | No | `null` | If not `null` and not empty, the supplied string will be used as the name (`.dmg` will be appended).

### APP configuration

The following other properties can be added to the `app` element configuring additional files to be included in the app bundle:

| Key | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `additionalResources` | List<Fileset> | No | | Additional files to be copied into the app bundle. |


```xml
 ...
    <configuration>
        <app>
            <additionalResources>
                <resource>
                    <directory>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources</directory>
                    <outputDirectory>Contents/Resources</outputDirectory>
                    <includes>
                        <include>**</include>
                    </includes>
                </resource>
            </additionalResources>
        </app>
    </configuration>
 ...
```

### JDK inclusion

Usually the application bundle built by the plugin will depend upon a Java runtime being available on the machine where the application is executed. To be completely self-sustaining, the plugin supports including the runtime into the target application. That runtime will then be used to launch the application, so there are not dependencies to a JDK being installed locally.

```xml
 ...
    <configuration>
      <jdk>
        <include>true</include>
        <location>/where/your/jdk/is/installed</location>
      </jdk>
    </configuration>
 ...
```

The following parameters can be set below the `jdk` configuration element:

| Key | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `include` | Boolean | No | `false` | Whether or not to include the JDK in the generated application bundle. |
| `location` | String | No | | The location of the JDK to be included. If no location is provided then the *currently used JDK* (which is the JDK that is used by the Maven binary) will be added to the application. |

### Native binary selection

By default the launcher contains a [universal binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary#Universal_2) that allows running the application on both the classic x86_64 as well as the new arm64 architecture.

In case any problems occur with the universal binary (or if you want to support only a specific architecture) you can select which binary should be bundled with your application via the `nativeBinary` setting:

```xml
 ...
    <configuration>
      <nativeBinary>X86_64</nativeBinary>
    </configuration>
 ...
```

The available values are:
- `UNIVERSAL` (the default if no explicit value is given)
- `X86_64`
- `ARM_64`

## Development

The project consists of two main parts: The regular *Maven plugin* (written in Java) and the *native macOS launcher* (written in Objective C).

Building the native part is fully integrated into the Maven lifecycle, so all you need to do to build the plugin is:

    $ git clone https://github.com/perdian/macosappbundler-maven-plugin.git
    $ mvn clean install

*I am aware that my understanding of Objective C is very basic - I'm not an Objective C developer by heart and going back to using pointers and (somewhat) manual memory management feels pretty strange. So a lot of what's in the code is highly cargo culted from tutorials and answers on Stackoverflow, but hey: It works!*

## Acknowledgments

I originally used and have been highly influenced by the [`appbundle-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/federkasten/appbundle-maven-plugin) from [`federkasten`](https://github.com/federkasten). Unfortunately the plugin stopped working with Java versions 10 and above (and didn't provide support for Java 9+ module projects).
